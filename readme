x86_64 linux only
usage: ./k file.k
or interactively: rlwrap ./k repl.k

if you have swap enabled, please create an alias that limits memory use, like
 alias k='ulimit -v 4000000 && rlwrap ./k repl.k'
to prevent an os freeze when you type something like !0W by mistake

errors are not recoverable and cause an exit()
support is poor for floating point, tables (flipped dicts), and i/o other than reading a file with mmap()

deliberate deviations from k:
 each of a unary verb doesn't require a colon. *'x and *:'x are "first each" but *' in isolation remains "times each"
 flip always returns a list of lists. +0 is +,0 is ,,0
