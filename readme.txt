k objs
 A - the type of a tagged k value or pointer
 x y z u - var names for A objs. usually x y z are the args and u is the result from the fn.
 xt xn xb - type, length, and bucket(as in buddy system) of x. similarly: yt,zn..
 tc tL tA.. - constants for k types
  tn - number of types
  ZT[t] - type size in bytes
  Zt[t] - base-2 logarithm of ZT[t]
 xtc xtL xtA.. - is x of type tc,tL,tA..? equivalent to xt==tc xt==tL xt==tA..
 xtt - is x an atom? (dicts are not considered atoms here)
 xtT - is x a list? (tables are not considered lists here)
 xR xr - refcount++ and --. if it drops to 0, free the obj (recursively if necessary)
  mr(x) - equivalent to xr
  m2(x,code) - execute a block of code after refcount-- but before collecting the obj
 xC xL xD xA.. - ptr to content of x as a char*,long*,double*,A*..
 xc xl.. - i-th typed element: xC[i],xL[i]..
 AT(x) AK(x) AV(x) AB(x) AN(x) AO(x) - setters for type,arity,verb,bucket,length,srcoffset
 At(x) Ak(x) Av(x) Ab(x) An(x) Ao(x) - getters, the actual fns behind the xt,xn.. macros
calling conventions
 A0 A1 A2 A3 - the types of functions with 0..3 args, accepting and returning type A.
  all args are consumed (their refcounts are decremented or they are returned as result).
  macros: A0(f,code) A1(f,code).. define such fns with args names x,y,z
 AA - like above but accepts a ptr to A and length; arg names: a and n
 AX - like AA but also accepts a separate arg called x, which is *not* consumed
 fns with ugly names (eg trailing "_" or uppercase) might not follow the conventions
 /*0*/ after an arg means "not consumed", /*1*/ means "consumed"
symbols
 symbols are represented similarly to ints and int lists. the following fns handle I <-> C* conversions:
 syC(c)    - macro for making a single-char symbol
 I syP(C*) - make a symbol from a '\0'-terminated string
 C*syp(I)  - get a ptr to the '\0'-terminated string
errors
 error-reporting fns return a null ptr after consuming their args:
  err("msg",x,y,z) - generic error. x,y,z are optional
  Et(c,x,y,z) El(c) En(c).. - if c signal type error, length error, nyi error.. x,y,z are optional
  etn(a,n) eln(a,n).. - variants that consume n objs from the memory pointed by a
 error-pass-through macros:
  N(expr) - if expr evaluates to null, N() returns from the current function,
            otherwise N(expr) is the same as expr
  Nx(expr) - same as N(), but if there's an error it consumes x
